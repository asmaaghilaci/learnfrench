## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mibarge/test/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

## Links and Images
[Link](url) and ![Image](src)

```

Here's a link explaining how to customise your github styles and template file:
[Customising Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/customizing-css-and-html-in-your-jekyll-theme/)

Here's an example of an image

![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)

You can also include plain old html. 

1) Here is the same image using HTML src code:
<img src="https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png" style="width:200px;">

2) The exercise below uses the iframe embed code to include an H5P exercise.

<iframe src="https://h5p.org/h5p/embed/36732" width="1090" height="401" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><script src="https://h5p.org/sites/all/modules/h5p/library/js/h5p-resizer.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mibarge/test/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
